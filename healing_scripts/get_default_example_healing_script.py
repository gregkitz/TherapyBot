Welcome to module number one, which is Release the Pain and the Immediate Feelings of Loss. So we're going to get started and I just need permission to come into your space. So please say yes out loud or in your mind. Okay, beautiful, thank you. Now I'm going to do a soul retrieval, which is a balance to prepare you for the healing. So just breathe and relax. Okay, and that's done. So we're going to start with shift number one, and this is about accessing the pain that's right there for you now. What is the obsessional thought or the thing that you know is stuck inside you, hurting you right now? You may know what it is, or maybe it's just a terrible feeling that you can't name yet, but you certainly feel it. And if you still aren't sure what it is, just set this intention. What is the trauma I most need to shift for my highest evolution right now? And then I want you to ask yourself, where is this trauma stuck in my body? Now take your attention inside, because something is going to light up for you. You'll feel it as pain, emotional or physical, or dense energy, or something like anxiety. Where is this painful feeling? Trust. Where do you feel the charge? Where do you feel that trauma? Is it in your chest or your heart? Is it in your solar plexus? Is it in your back? Is it so big that you feel it everywhere? Really trust and write down where you feel it in the details section of shift number one. Now ask this part of you carrying this trauma, how old are you? And this is in relation to a previous self, a younger you, or an ancient past life self. And just trust your intuitive message of the age of this trauma, or whatever comes up for you as the answer. And record this in the details section as well. If you don't get any information as such, rather than trying to get it, I want you to instead to tune into the quality of this painful energy that you feel in your body, no matter how subtle it is. Does the trauma feel like it's dark or solid or porous? What are the features of it? Is it big or small? Trust your imagination and write down how this wound appears in your mind's eye, inside of you, or how it feels. There's no right or wrong, just trust. And write down what you receive. Okay, so now what we're going to do with body open and breathing and being present with this trauma inside, we're going to ask what is this inner wound really about? And do this with love and devotion so that your inner being can trust you and open up to you. Don't censor or judge what comes up, just allow your inner being to express what is being felt right now. And if no information comes, then I want you to feel into the wound that you've connected to and ask the trauma if it has any words or feelings to share with you. And if nothing comes up at all, just stay with this wound for a few moments with your body open and breathing, being super present lovingly with it. And I'm going to give you a minute to record what this is about, the information or what the wound has to share with you, or just being present with the wound in your body. I'm going to give you a minute to do that starting now. So okay, now what I want you to do is tap into what you've written down and if you didn't get any information, just be with that part of yourself in your body unconditionally. And we're going to feel the trauma and rate the charge out of 10. Zero being the lowest, 10 being the highest. And really claim it, feel it as much as you can and write your rating down in the before section of shift number one. Okay, so now we're going to start shifting. So with body open and breathing, we've got the energy of shift number one as a swirling mass inside you. And we're going to put in there the associated pain, the shock, the fear, the burden, the trauma, the grief, the anxiety, the anger, the resentment, the brokenness, the powerlessness, and every other emotion and confusion that goes with that. And just breathe and keep your body open and we're also loading into there any past life situations, events, occurrences, attachments, belief systems, survival programs, and emotions. And just breathe and relax. And now we're going to load up all the energy from parallel future and multidimensional lives. And we're going to put in there any beliefs on soul, personal and genetic level, and the genes and the DNA that go with all of that too. Okay, so we've got all of that loaded up. So now we're going to open up and surrender and release. And together we do this. I want you to imagine all of that stuff inside you and we're going to spiral it all up to the top of your head and we're going to let it go. And what I want you to do is as you're releasing, see big blobs of these parts of you that are not the real you, leave you. And as they leave your body through the top of your head, they all disappear. And as you're letting go, I want you to imagine all of that stuff inside you and we're going to spiral it all up to the top of your head and we're going to let it go. And what I want you to do is as you're releasing, see big blobs of these parts of you that are not the real you, leave you. And as they leave your body through the top of your head, they all dissolve back to nothingness, back to love for recycling, freeing your inner being. So we're doing that now. Okay. And that's done. All right. So now go to your sacred space and imagine yourself there. And in this space, we're going to bring down into you and this space, unconditional love and self-acceptance and support. And it feels you and this space like a beautiful, big, warm, soft pillow. And we're going to connect you up to the Source Energy Grand Design Truth for this next level of clearing, which is the dissolving of all of those beliefs and energies of shift number one, back to native nothingness and back to space. And now we're setting up the Source Healing and the resolution of shift number one, which is the healing that our superconscious performs, which is the reinstating you back to your true
yourself on this topic. And the subconscious mind of this healing container says yes to that. Now imagine yourself as a container, or an actual container is the next level of clearing. And I want you to imagine the junk in there that represents the wound that you've identified. And I want you to push all of this stuff out to the sides with your visualization tool of choice. And when you push it out to the sides, see it dissolve into native nothingness for recycling back to love. So do that now until you're clean, clear and open. Now imagine a pipeline that goes up from you to a big ball of source energy above your head. And in that big ball of energy is your highest self, source and the healing of this wound. It's the resolution of this trauma reinstating you back to your true self on this topic. There is nothing for you to work out, only this energy to accept. Now imagine this energy is pure light coming down the pipeline and it's filling up the cells of your body. And as it's doing so all darkness and shadows disappear. And your inner being is awakening and spreading the identical light throughout you as well. And you fill with so much light that you literally burst into a ball of light. And now for the next level of clearing. Imagine you're in a child, in a being or any beings who need to be present for this healing. And trust whoever and however many arrive. Bring this being or beings who are carrying the trauma over to you. And then imagine that angels or other higher energies are coming in and around and surrounding them and reaching inside to take out the big balls of painful trauma and taking it up and throwing it away. And again, the trauma once removed dissolves back to love for recycling, freeing their inner beings. Now whilst hugging your inner being or beings, pull the white light, the source healing from you into them. See the inner self of this being or beings also awaken and spread white light throughout. All darkness and shadows disappear and they fill with so much light that they burst into balls of light. Now bring the inner being or beings inside of you so that you all integrate together as the one ball of light. And then see the angels or higher energies coming in around you and they're surrounding you and they're reaching inside your body and switching on your genes. The cells of your body open up and source energy is flowing through you as you and you are a glowing ball of light. And then take that glow out further and fill up your auric field with it. And then glow it right out and take it out into the field and see it join up with the glow that is the field. And then step out into the glow with any dark parts or shadows of yourself remaining from the trauma and that all dissolves back to love, freeing you to be the glow, to be the light. As this ball of light with body open with no thought, just breathe and be it. And say this out loud, I am the light, the light I am, it just is. And just be it and breathe it. Okay, so we're going to integrate that shift and we're going to bring it through all space, time and dimension, past lives, parallel lives, future lives, this life right here, right now, as if you've always known it. We're going to bring it all in. We are going to integrate that. Okay, and take a couple of deep breaths. All right, so what I want you to do now is go back to the details that you wrote down. Or if you didn't get any information, go back to the feeling in your body. And we're going to check the after rating now. And I want you to really go for it. Really open and breathing, pick up that trauma and feel it in your body and give it a rating out of 10. Zero being the lowest, 10 being the highest. And write that down in the after section of shift number one. If you did have a rating left, we're going to pick up that remaining trauma and shift it in shift number two. If you can't find the trauma, you can either go to the end of this healing and close the healing off. Or if you want to do another shift, all you need to do is set the intention that you will target the next trauma that your body can release. Okay, so with the remaining trauma or new trauma, go to the resistance in your body, the charge that you're working on. Where is this painful feeling in your body? And I want you to write down the location in the details section of shift number two. Now how old is this part of yourself, this previous self? Is it a childhood age or is it an ancient past life situation? Write down your answer. And if you don't have any information, write down how the trauma appears in your mind's eye, what it feels like. What is the composition of it? Trust. And now let's ask this trauma whilst you are super present with it in your body. What is this really about? And if you don't get any visions, feelings or information come up for you, then ask the trauma itself. Do you have anything to share with me about you? And whichever the case, stay loving, accepting and fascinating about what is revealed. If nothing comes, then just stay open and breathing whilst being with the trauma in your body. And I'll give you a minute to record information or just be with the trauma and start that now. So now, going to the details that you wrote about in shift number two, what is it about? Shift number twoj
you didn't get any information just be with this part of yourself inside your body and I want you to feel the painful charge. Okay, body open and breathing and feel it as much as you can. Give it a rating out of ten and write that down in the before section of shift number two. Okay, let's shift. So with body open and breathing we've got the energy of shift number two and we've got it as a swirling mass inside you and we're putting in there the associated pain, the shock, the fear, the burden, the trauma, the grief, the anxiety, the anger, the resentment, the brokenness, the powerlessness and every other emotion and confusion that goes with that. Okay, just keep breathing with your body open and we're going to put in there any past life situations, events, occurrences, attachments, belief systems, survival programs and emotions that are also contributing and breathe and we're going to load in there the energy from parallel, future and multi-dimensional lives. Breathing and we're going to put in there any beliefs on soul, personal and genetic level and the genes and the DNA that go with all of that too. Okay, wonderful. So we've got the energy of shift number two loaded and we're now going to open up and release it from inside of you. So we're going to let all of this stuff go, sending it back to source life and creation, seeing all of those blobs dissolving out of you, back to love and nothingness for recycling and we're doing that now. Freeing your inner being from this trauma and it's still going. Okay and we are done. So now go to your sacred space, imagine yourself there and in this space we're going to bring down into you and this space unconditional love and self-acceptance and support and it fills you and this space like a beautiful big warm soft pillow and we're going to connect you up to the source energy grand design truth for this next clearing which is the dissolving of all of the beliefs and these energies back to native nothingness and back to space. Now we're setting up this source healing of shift number two which is the reinstatement of you back to your true self on this topic. This is the healing that our superconscious performs and the subconscious mind of this healing container says yes to that. Now imagine yourself as a container or an actual container and in this container is chunks of the trauma and I want you to push all of that stuff out to the sides with your visualization tool of choice and see it dissolve back to love for recycling until you're clean, clear and open and we're going to do that now. Now see the big ball of sauce above your head and in this is the resolution of this trauma. This is your true self replacement of it and there is nothing for you to work out only this energy to accept and imagine this energy is pure light and it's coming down the pipeline and as it fills up the cells of your body all darkness and shadows disappear and your inner being is awakening and also spreading the identical light throughout you as well and you fill with so much light that you burst into a ball of light and now for the next level of clearing imagine you're in a child in a being or any beings who need to be present for this healing showing up and you'll see your sense whoever and however many arrive. Bring this being or beings who are carrying the trauma over to you and then imagine that angels or other higher beings are coming in and around and surrounding them and reaching inside to take out the big balls of painful trauma and take it up and away and again the trauma once removed dissolves back to love for recycling. Now whilst hugging your inner being or the multiple beings pour the white light the source healing from you into them. See the inner self of this being or beings also awaken and spread white light throughout all darkness and shadows disappear and they fill with so much light that they burst into balls of light. Now bring the inner being or beings inside of you so that you all integrate together as the one ball of light and then see the angels or higher energies coming in around you and they surround you and they're reaching inside your body and switching on your genes. The cells of your body open up and source energy is flowing through you as you and you are a glowing ball of light. Then take that glow out further and fill up your auric field with it and then glow it right out into the field see it join up with the glow that is the field of all that is and then step out into the glow with any dark parts or shadows of yourself remaining from the trauma and see those dissolve back to love freeing you to be the glow to be the light as this ball of light with body open with no thought just breathe and be it and say this out loud I am the light the light I am it just is and be it okay so what I want you to do now is go back to the details that you wrote down regarding shift number two or if you didn't get anything go back to the feeling in your body and we're going to check the after rating now and I want you to really go for it body open and breathing feel what trauma is now left in your body and give it a rating out of ten and write it down in the after section if you didn't have any trauma remaining on this wound then just proceed through to the end of this healing if you do have trauma remaining it's my highest suggestion that you go back to the start of this healing as soon as you can and keep shifting until you've brought the trauma down to a zero okay so it's now time to close off so let's do that now so we're going to seal off this healing and we're going to bring through that this is an instant healing you've received an instant healing your body knows how to retain this healing and it has retained this healing and you now move forward into the matrix of life with your beliefs and your emotions aligned with the integrity of yourself your will is divine will it's all true
and the truth sets you free. Okay and I am now up and out of your space. So that's it for me now with healing number one and I so know you're going to start feeling incredible relief really soon. You're doing an amazing job. Lots of love. Bye bye.
